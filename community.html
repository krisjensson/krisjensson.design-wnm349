      <h3>Bees Importance</h3>

        Globally there are more honey bees than other types of bee and
        pollinating insects, so it is the world’s most important pollinator of
        food crops. It is estimated that one third of the food that we consume
        each day relies on pollination mainly by bees, but also by other
        insects, birds and bats.
