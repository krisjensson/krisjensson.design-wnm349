      <h3>Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        With the dashboard we do everything we can to make it as simple for you
        as possible. Here you can see everything that is going on with your
        beehive. We make sure that if there is something wrong you can notice it
        right away and with the option to push in notifications.

      <h3>Strength</h3>
      <p>
        The strength of a hive refers to the number of bees in the hive. A hive
        consists of one or more compartments, called supers. A strong colony has
        about 15.000 - 20.000 bees in each super. With our traffic sensor in the
        bottom boarder we can estimate the bee population.
      </p>

      <h3>Harvest</h3>
      <p>
        When you want to enjoy your honey you simply empty a frame and the honey
        will flow down into your container. The container has weight sensors so
        you can see how full it is. To empty the container we built in
        fingerscan tap so the bears stay away.
      </p>

      <h3>Condition</h3>
      <p>
        The most importand aspect for the bee broods is temperature. One of the
        reason why were loosing bees is because of weather conditions. Aiza
        makes sure that you can see and change the humidity or temperature of
        your beehive through the app.

      <h3>Frames</h3>
      <p>
        Where the action happens. In your upper super you have six frames all
        with different colour. Each frame has weight sensor so you can now how
        much honey the bees have made. When it is time we will let you know and
        you can empty the frame into the container.

      <h3>My Yard</h3>
      <p>
        With my yard you can change the colour of your beehive and also add UV
        glow. The colours are the bees three favorites blue, violet and purple.
        We recommend the first three weeks you keep the colour the same after
        that time you can start playing a little bit.
