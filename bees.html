      <h3>Bees Importance</h3>
      <p>
        Globally there are more honey bees than other types of bee and
        pollinating insects, so it is the world’s most important pollinator of
        food crops. It is estimated that one third of the food that we consume
        each day relies on pollination mainly by bees, but also by other
        insects, birds and bats.

      <h3>Bees and the Economy</h3>
      <p>
        In 2018, the Bee Keepers Association estimates that honey bees make a
        significant contribution to the $16 billion annually generated for the
        US economy through pollination by insects, with the figure put at $20
        billion in 2019 by the US’s Public Accounts Committee. Many flowering
        food crops in the US rely on honey bees for this service, for example:
        apples, pears, field beans, runner and dwarf beans, broad beans.<br /><br />
        The bumble bee is also used commercially in the UK as a pollinator of
        food crops, in particular for tomatoes and soft fruits such as
        strawberries. Due to their size, shape and ability to vibrate vigorously
        they are more effective at pollinating certain crops. In the US we have
        25 native species of bumble bee. This may seem like a healthy number but
        unfortunately three species are already extinct, two are critically
        endangered and many more are seriously declining in numbers
